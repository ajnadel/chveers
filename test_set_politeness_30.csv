157024,qb cade mcnown ( chi ) could probably play this week if needed .
157034,qb brian griese ( den ) will miss another game and may not be ready to play= = 20 the last game of the regular season as earlier reported .

157154,( swepco in texas ) and see if it will help in ohio .

157172,"thanks , jim < < file : puct on order 13.doc"
157176,"the form we have has this as the first paragraph , which is different from t= he=20 form attached ."
157192,"jeff , thanks for your work on bob 's draft , however , for form management purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include the crossborder annexes ."
157195,it is for this reason that i think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just canada / us .
